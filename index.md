# Introduction to Git and GitHub

Learn the basics of using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.  Git is a widely used version control software that tracks changes to a group of files, referred to as a repository.  GitHub is a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories, making it easier to collaborate and share your work.  Together, Git and GitHub provide a platform that is increasingly used for collaboration in research and academic environments.  

In this beginner workshop, participants will learn key concepts, create their own Git repository, and publish to GitHub.  No previous experience with Git is required.  Familiarity with the command line interface will be helpful but is not necessary.
