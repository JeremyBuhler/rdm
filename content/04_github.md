# Github features

Github is a great resource for programmers and enthusiasts. Many open-source projects are hosted on Github. Among them, you can find [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), and [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). You can even find riginal code for [Windows Calculator app](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator) on Github. 

Github also has many great features that support project development and management. Here, you can find a list of those features and some notes on collaborating with other teams members on Github.

* **Github issues** let you track your work on Github. When you mention an issue in another issue or pull-request, the issue's timeline tracks the related work. You can link issues to pull requests.

* **Gist code** is a simple way to share code snippets with others. It is used when you need to share a sample piece of code or technique with your co-workers or friends. To learn more Github Gists and how to create them, check out [Github Tutorial on Creating Gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)

* **Project management with Github** is possible is Github offers a card-based project management tool like the one offered by [Trello](https://trello.com/). To begin the setup process, you should click on the **projects** tab in your repository and select **create a project**. Github offers templates to organize tasks within the project workflow. You can also set automatic triggers and link them to Github pull requests.

* **Github Wiki** is a feature on Github to host the documentation of the repository. You can edit wikis directly on Github or edit wiki files locally. Github Docs give you more information about [Github Wikis](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis).

* **Github Pages** is a static site hosting website that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on Github and publishes a website with them. To learn more about this feature, you can check [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) or the [Introduction to Jekyll](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/) workshop.
