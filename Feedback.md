Positive Feedbacks from previous workshops:

- Hands on activity
- Liked having the script to follow along with the commands & what they actioned
- The complete pre-workshop preparation
- Ability of the tutors to accommodate all participants and make them feel welcome.
- I like that Billie made the screen super large and the pace is pretty good!
- How you really held our had through the whole process. It was very step by step which made it easier to understand 
- The strategy of working from local first, then moving to remote helped us undestand how the commands work and build a better foundation before moving to the syncing portion, which is probably where a lot of people would usually get confused. 
- going over the set up from the beginning. Also great to have a helper available during the workshop
- Interactive!


Negative Feedbacks from previous workshops:

- The instructor was good at explaining git terminology
It might make sense to split this into a basic git intro in small groups (maybe even by degree/background)and an advanced workshop. people who haven't worked with the command line are overwhelmed by this, and those who have are a bit underwhelmed. 
- Pace. Maybe a bit slower in the way some of the content was delivered. I would have liked to see some of the steps covered more than once or slowed down a bit more. 
- Spent way too long on tasks that were suppoed to be completed pre-workshop (installing software)
- It barely covered anything, partially because the install was very tech-y. Perhaps send install videos or articles with the registration. 
- It would be great if Billie could clearly introduce the concept of some commands. Like why we we are doing it, for what kind of purposes.
- It was very interesting but a bit fast paced, it would have been nice to have more time in the workshop and more explanations for people who are not familiar with bash, eg. why use command lines instead of directly github..
- Talk a little about the philosophy and history of github
- More information about using Git on a Mac
- Allot more time! Pacing was very fast, and I feel like there was a lot more that would have been nice to have been taught.
